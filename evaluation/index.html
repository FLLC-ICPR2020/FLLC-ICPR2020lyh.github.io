  <h2 id="detail-requirements">Detail Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The upper bound of computational complexity is 1G FLOPs.</li>
<li>The upper bound of model size is 20MB.</li>
<li>We provide the bounding boxes obtained by our detector for training/validation/test sets. However, participants have the choice of employing other face detectors.</li>
<li>Except for the face detectors, any external datasets and models are not allowed. Any test augmentation is prohibited. The multi-model ensemble strategy is also not allowed.</li>
<li>During the validation phase, participants need send the the landmark files (.txt) with the same format of the training data to <a href="mailto:FLLC_ICPR2020@163.com">FLLC_ICPR2020@163.com</a>, and we will return the results to the participants and update the leaderboard. Each team can only submit once one day.</li>
<li>After the test images are released on June 24, 2020 [00:00 a.m. Central European Standard Time], each team only has 24 hours to predict the test results.Both the predicted test results and the training materials (codes, models and technical reports) need to send to us. ¸Ä³ÉBoth the predicted test results and the training materials (codes, models and technical reports) need to send to us before June 25, 2020 [00:00 a.m. Central European Standard Time].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evaluation-criterion">Evaluation Criterion:</h2>
<p>Submissions will be evaluated on the area-under-the-curve (AUC) from the cumulative errors distribution (CED) curves. Besides, further statistics from the CED curves such as the failure rate and average normalized mean error (NME) will also be returned to the participants for inclusion in their papers.
The cumulative curve corresponding to the percentage of test images of which the error is less than a threshold alpha will be produced. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) is the area under the cumulative distribution curve calculated up to the threshold alpha, then divided by that threshold. We set the value of alpha to be 0.08. Similarly, we consider each image with a point-to-point normalized mean error of alpha or greater as failure. NME is computed as:</p>
<p><img src="https://FLLC-ICPR2020.github.io/pic/NME.png" alt=""></p>
<p>where x denotes the ground truth landmarks for a given face, y denotes the corresponding prediction and d is computed as d=sqrt(width_bbox*height_bbox). Here, width_bbox and width_bbox are the width and height of the enclosing rectangle of the ground truth landmarks.</p>
